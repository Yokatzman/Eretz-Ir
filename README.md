# Eretz Ir 2
"Eretz Ir 2" is a refreshing take on the traditional kids game "Eretz Ir".
Divided to groups, each groups gets a random letter, and a limited time to get as much definitions as possible in the given letter.
Built with **Android Studio** The Eretz Ir 2 android app is the game management tool for the game "referee" to use, allowing comfortable managing of the different timers needed, randomizing definitions and letter, and keeping score.

## Motivation
playing this game a few times in it's regular "real life" version, I've noticed the volunteering game manager always struggles- managing the timers each round, choosing the definition to read, and keeping tracks of how many right answers each group got.
therefore I decided to write an app to eliminate all of these challenges.

## Game Progress
Firstly, the game manager chooses the different game attributes - Number of Teams, Rounds, Seconds per Round, Seconds per Question.

A letter is randomized for the first team:

The round is played, giving the game manager all the needed information, randomizing definitions, and marking right and wrong answers (after each marking a new definition is randomized)

After each turn, all the logged answers are presented to the manager, for changes, if necessary:

the cycle keeps occuring for each round and round, counting the amount of won rounds for each group, eventually presenting the winning team.

## Installation

As of now, the app is not in a public app store of some sort. to install, open the project in android studio and build an apk file, transport it to your android device, install and enjoy!
