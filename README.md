# Eretz Ir 2

"Eretz Ir 2" is a refreshing take on the traditional kids game "Eretz Ir".
Divided to groups, each groups gets a random letter, and a limited time to get as much definitions as possible in the given letter.
The Eretz Ir 2 android app is the game management tool for the game "referee" to use, allowing comfortable managing of the different timers needed, randomizing definitions and letter, and keeping score.

## motivation
playing this game a few times in it's regular "real life" version, I've noticed the volunteering game manager always struggles- managing the timers each round, choosing the definition to read, and keeping tracks of how many right answers each group got.
therefore I decided to write an app to eliminate all of these challenges.
